We have sidewalks with tactile plates and crosswalks with chirps and lights with signals but we often forget other aspects that can impact access. If we could see where there is a long delay for snow removal, that can help us better understand our service priorities, we could change where we put our priorities.”

One of my easiest routes is through a parking lot but that is not safe for me. I found a backway, it involves a sidewalk and not the way a normal sighted person would walk, only I would go that way, it is the safest. Last year it was under construction. It was unsafe for me but I didn’t know.”

                    Dangers are not limited to physical objects, often dangers are associated with human behaviour. SafePath collects instances of dangerous and risky events and occurrences such as near hits in intersections or crosswalks, aggressive behaviour or object blocking bike lanes. This data provides citizens and municipal decision-makers with quantitative support of zones that require prioritized street-level activity monitoring or safety enhancements. Previously this data was fragmented across 311 records, social media posts and communication to elected officials.
